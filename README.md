# Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM, SVM, and BERT

## Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis using three different models: LSTM, SVM, and BERT Transformer. The models are trained on the IMDB dataset. The project includes data preprocessing before model training. The trained models are then used for sentiment analysis of YouTube comments, with detailed statistics generated from these comments.

## Features
- **LSTM Model**: Long Short-Term Memory network for sequence prediction, implemented using TensorFlow.
- **SVM Model**: Support Vector Machine for classification tasks, implemented using scikit-learn (sklearn).
- **BERT Transformer**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for advanced sentiment analysis, implemented using PyTorch.

## Dataset
- **IMDB Dataset**: Used for training and validation.
- **Twitter and Amazon Datasets**: Tested but showed worse performance compared to the IMDB dataset.
